Hello to all,

Congratulations!
If you are receiving this email, it is because your abstract was selected by our technical program evaluation team and you will be a speaker at this year’s Symposium. 

I have attached the complete program agenda file for your reference.  Please look at the tabs for Days 2 and 3 to find your specific presentation time slots.  If you submitted more than one abstract and they do not all appear in the agenda, then the others were not selected.  The agenda is also online on the symposium website, but this file provides a more compact format for quicker reference.  And unlike the online version, this Excel file will not be updated if any changes become necessary.

This email contains the details of what you need to know about registration, your final set of presentation slides, and some logistics about some things onsite at the meeting.

REGISTRATION:
•	To get your free registration pass as a speaker, use this discount coupon code when you register:  23MCESSPKR
•	If you have one or more co-presenters, and they are not otherwise registered, give them this discount coupon code to register with a $300 discount:  23MCESCSPK
•	Please get everyone registered no later than 29 March to confirm and finalize your presentation time slot so we know it is firm.

FINAL PRESENTATION SLIDES:
•	Please insert the two attached header slides at the front of your presentation. I have provided a sets for both Windows and Apple iOS operating systems.
•	Your final presentation slide set is due no later than 5 May 2023.  Upload instructions:
o	File format:  PDF
o	File name convention:  <last name>.<first name initial>.pdf
Please upload it to:  https://www.dropbox.com/request/yGQ4KWVc5omp3b1td9qz

ONSITE LOGISTICS:
•	Your one-hour time slot is structured to allow a 40-minute presentation, a 10-minute question and answer (Q&A) period, and a 10-minute buffer at the end to allow people to move between tracks. Depending on the final content of your specific presentation, you can adjust these three periods slightly as long as you leave some time for questions and for people to move to another track before the next presentation time.
•	Your presentation will be recorded using a direct-capture device.  That device expects a male HDMI connector on the input cable, so please come with the appropriate adaptor if your presentation device needs one.
•	You will use a wireless lapel microphone for your presentation, and that audio signal will be fed to the direct-capture device as an output from the presentation room’s  sound system mixer. Any audio that your presentation may have (such as for an embedded video) needs to be captured also, so please set your presentation device to route audio to the MIC connector rather than the HDMI/VIDEO OUT connector, if the device has that option.
•	The room setups do not lend themselves well to having a floor standing or roving hand-held  microphone, so during the Q&A period, please remember to re-state the questions before you answer them.

Thank you for your interest in, and support of, our annual MBSE Cyber Experience Symposium.  We look forward to seeing you there!
